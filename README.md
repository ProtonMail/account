### U2F

Testing U2F can be complicated: the server must accept a U2F binding on the localhost domain. 
For that, the domain  must use the app id https://localhost.

In order to test U2F without having a physical device, the chrome extension [virtual-u2f](https://github.com/alykoshin/virtual-u2f) can be used. 
This extension is suitable for test usage only! Mac users can also try the [SoftU2F](https://github.com/github/SoftU2F) project (maintained by github, more secure than virtual-u2f).
